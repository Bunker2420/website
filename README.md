YouTube Clone is a simple front-end project I created while learning HTML and CSS to practice my layout and styling skills. This project helped me understand how real-world websites are structured and styled, especially large-scale platforms like YouTube.

Through this clone, I practiced:

📐 Page layout design using Flexbox and CSS Grid

🎨 Styling consistency with buttons, thumbnails, and navigation bars

🧭 Navigation bar and sidebar structure

🖼️ Responsive video grid and content cards

Although it doesn’t include dynamic functionality (JavaScript), this project helped me gain confidence in building pixel-perfect UI and understanding how to structure content cleanly and efficiently. It was a valuable step in my front-end development learning path.
